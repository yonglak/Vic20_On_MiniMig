Protocol on the serial line

Design criterion: simplicity

The line must transceive 8-bit bytes.  It must be possible to
distinguish the data payload from the control stream.  It would be
tempting to mark the control stream with non-standard transmission
patterns, such as intentional framing errors or breaks.  However,
since these non-standard patterns are not uniformly supported across
different platforms, it is best to stay with standard data streams.

Data encapsulation is arranged by using a prefix-closed command
language.  The safety measures against out-of-sync errors are that the
controller enters the idle mode upon the reception of a break signal
or an unrecognized command byte.  When the controller is receiving
regular data bytes or command parameters, it does not accept commands.
When the controller receives a command byte, it responds by sending the
command byte ORed with 0x30.

The main handshaking method is XON/XOFF, which is used during periods
of excessive communication (when receiving data in the "load" and
custom "send" functions).  The computer may not interrupt the
controller during any operations, but the controller may interrupt the
computer by sending DC1 (ctrl-s) when its input buffer is filling up
with data.  The transfer is resumed by sending DC3 (ctrl-q) when the
buffer is getting empty.

Packets originated by the computer

- Set operating mode (MM PP ...):
  - MM=0x00: idle (do nothing)
    - the controller flushes its buffers
    - the cassette sense signal is negated
  - MM=0x01: pulse width measurement mode (on cassette write signal)
  - MM=0x02: read data from cassette write signal
    - PP ... = short medium long (maximum pulse widths; unit=8 탎)
  - MM=0x03: write data to cassette read signal
    - PP ... = pause short medium long (8-bit pulse widths; unit=8 탎)
  - MM=0x04: send PPPP bytes using custom protocol
    - the command byte is followed by the LSB and MSB of the
      number of bytes to send (minus 1) and by the actual data bytes
  - MM=0x05: receive PPPP bytes using custom protocol
    - the command byte is followed by the LSB and MSB of the
      number of bytes to send (minus 1)
    - when the data has been received by the other end, a '@' character
      is echoed to the serial line
  - MM=0x06: calibrate and receive PPPP bytes using custom protocol
    - the command byte is followed by the LSB and MSB of the
      number of bytes to send (minus 1)
    - the first byte the C= is expected to send is $f0, which is used as
      a calibration aid and is not forwarded to the RS-232 line
    - when the data has been received by the other end, a '@' character
      is echoed to the serial line
- Pulse width (MM=0x03)
  - 'A'=pause
  - 'B'=short
  - 'C'=medium
  - 'D'=long
- raw data (MM=0x04)
  - any byte in the range 0x00..0xff

Packets originated by the controller

- Pulse width measurement mode (MM=0x01; WW):
  - WW=pulse width (unit=8 탎)
- Pulse width (MM=0x02)
  - 'A'=pause
  - 'B'=short
  - 'C'=medium
  - 'D'=long
- Raw data (MM=0x05)
- Start transfer (MM=0x02 or MM=0x04; DC3, 0x13):
  - issued whenever the buffer becomes 75% empty
- Stop transfer (MM=0x02 or MM=0x04; DC1, 0x11):
  - issued whenever the buffer becomes 75% full

Connections:

- cassette write: PD6 (input capture)
- cassette read:  PB3 (output compare)
- cassette sense: PB0

pulse width measurement unit = 8 MHz/64 = 125 kHz = 8 탎
